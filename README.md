# bike-sharing-case-study-
The data to study is taken from kaggle. The dataset is of a company who wants to understand the demand for shared bikes among people after this ongoing quarintine situation across world due to covid-19.

In this project, I have tried to find the variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. I have prepared a model using regression to study the demand for shared bikes with available independent variables.
